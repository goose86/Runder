Runder is an interactive website that not only allows users to decide which ski runs are 
the best fit for them, it also gives them information such as chairlifts to take, which 
resort the runs are at and what type of terrain the runs are located. The is a user-friendly 
website that is simple to use and is also a great safety tool as users can decide the 
difficulty without accidentally “running” into a double-black diamond. 

Runder was initially created in Microsoft MySQL Workbench which we then transferred to 
Westminster’s Cerberus server. From there, we completed the user-interface using HTML 
and PHP in Adobe Dreamweaver.
